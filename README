Atomvm is a tiny virtual machine that runs on Windows and can be debugged 
from an IDE like Microsoft Visual C++ Express. The primary purpose of this 
virtual machine is for the evaluation of Real Time Operating Systems like 
Atomthreads and the development and testing of programs for it on a Windows 
machine.

Atomvm makes use of the Windows API functions GetThreadContext() and 
SetThreadContext() to create multiple virtual contexts or threads inside a 
single Windows thread. Atomvm also simulates interrupts with an interrupt 
mask accessible from the Atomvm threads. External events can be queued as 
interrupts to Atomvm, for example a timer loop generating system timer tick 
interrupts for a Real Time Operating System ported to Atomvm.
