*
* @authors Natie van Rooyen
*
* @section intro Introduction
* Atomvm is a tiny virtual machine that can run on Windows inside an IDE with a 
* debugger like Microsoft Visual C++ Express. The primary purpose of this virtual 
* machine is for the evaluation of Real Time Operating Systems (like atomthreads) 
* and the development and testing of modules for this Real Time Operating System
* in a user friendly environment.:
* 
* @section build Building The Source
* To test this project, just add all the files from the "atomthreads/kernel" 
* directory and the "atomthreads/ports/atomvm" directory as well as the test 
* program main.c to your project. Add both the 
* before mentioned directories to the include paths of your project and compile. \n
* Atomvm was designed for multi core systems but also runs fine on any single 
* core system.
*
* @section test Running The Test
* The test, main.c, is intentioned to stress the virtual  machine as opposed to 
* testing the Real Time Operating System. However, this test can also run the 
* unit tests of atomthreads by using the preprocessor directive "UNIT_TESTS" and 
* linking in the desired unit test into the project.
